                    <p>Table tennis, also known as ping pong, is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball back and forth across a table using small bats. <br> The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net. Except for the initial
                        serve, <br>the rules are generally as follows: players must allow a ball played toward them to bounce one time on their side of the table, and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side at least once. <br>A point is
                        scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules.<br> Play is fast and demands quick reactions.<br> Spinning the ball alters its trajectory and limits an opponent's options, giving the hitter a great advantage.<br>

                        <span class="governance">Table tennis is governed by the worldwide organization International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), founded in 1926. ITTF currently includes 226 member associations.[3] The table tennis official rules are specified in the ITTF handbook.[4] Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988,[5] with several event categories. From 1988 until 2004, these were men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles and women's doubles. Since 2008, a team event has been played instead of the doubles.</span>
